# Proxmox

## Objective

Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform that combines KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and LXC (Linux Containers) to provide a comprehensive solution for managing virtual environments. It is a powerful tool for running multiple virtual machines and containers on a single physical server. Proxmox allows users to manage virtual machines, storage, networking, and clusters through an easy-to-use web-based interface. It also supports high availability, backups, and scaling, making it suitable for both small businesses and large enterprise environments.

### Skills Learned

Virtualization Management – I learned how to create and manage virtual machines and containers, which are essential for handling virtualized environments in real-world scenarios.
Linux System Administration – I gained hands-on experience with Linux, which improved my ability to work with Linux-based systems and perform administrative tasks in IT environments.
Networking Configuration – I developed skills in configuring networking for virtual machines, including setting up bridges, VLANs, and storage networking, which are critical for managing networked infrastructure.
Backup & Disaster Recovery – I became knowledgeable in managing VM backups, snapshots, and disaster recovery processes, ensuring data integrity and availability in case of failures.
Cloud Infrastructure Setup – I gained knowledge in setting up and managing cloud-like infrastructure using Proxmox’s clustering features, which enhanced my understanding of how to scale and manage virtualized resources in cloud environments.
